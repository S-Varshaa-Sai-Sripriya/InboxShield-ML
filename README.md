## ðŸ§  Problem Statement

Email spam remains one of the most prevalent digital nuisances. This project trains a supervised learning model to classify whether an email is **spam or not** based on its textual content. The pipeline includes preprocessing, vectorization, training, and performance evaluation.

## ðŸš€ Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword filtering  
   - Lemmatization using `nltk`  

2. **Vectorization**  
   - TF-IDF applied on cleaned email text

3. **Modeling**  
   - Logistic Regression (primary classifier)  
   - Baseline: Naive Bayes  
   - Evaluation: Accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC AUC

4. **Result**  
   - Achieved **97.9%+ accuracy** and robust spam detection performance.
